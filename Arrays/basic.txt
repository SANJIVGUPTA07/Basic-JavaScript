In javaScript array are the variable which can store more than one value
example:
    const fruit = {"apple","orange","Mango};
    const val = {7,"javaScript",false};

In array their are some method and properties which is used to 
manipulate the array
And these methods are as follow
1)toString() : it converts array to string of comma separated value
2)join() : join all the array elements using a separator
3)pop() : it is used to remove the last element from an array
4)push() : it is used to add the element at the end of array
5)shift() : it remove the first element and returns it
6)unShift() : add element at beginning and returns new array length
7)delete : used to delete array element 
            example
                let d = [7,1,2,3,4]
                delete d[index] i.e delete d[0] i.e delete 7

8)conCat() : used to join to different array into single array
9)sort() : sort array element *alphabetically(a,b,c,d,e..)*
10)splice() : used to add new items in array and it returns 
              deleted items and it modifies an array

              example:
                const number = [1,2,3,4,5];
                
                number.splice( position_to_add , no. of element to remove , elements to be added using comma separated);

                number.splice(2,1,23,11);
                it will return deleted array item and modifies the original array
11)slice() : slice out a piece from an array.it create a new array
12)reverse() : it reverse array elements
